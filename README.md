# frc-cpp-project-skeleton
This is a skeleton for FRC C++ projects using CMake.  Fork me!  Example usage:
```
cmake .
make # make your robot code
make deploy # deploy your robot code, configure team number in CMakeLists.txt
make doxygen # build doxygen docs
make check # run tests, see test/
```

The ci-test target depends on Boost.Test.

TODO:
* Improve test/wpilib-harness and move it to its own repository
